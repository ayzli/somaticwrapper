Workflow in this directory is created for testing the docker image outside of the MGI environment
Testing is done with the Strelka test dataset

Note that 0_ is run within the docker environment

Also note that the Dockerfile has passwords associated with it, so it is not for distribution until 
somatic_wrapper is public
