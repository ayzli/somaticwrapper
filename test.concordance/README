Evaluating concordance with Song's run for
1) original dbSnP
2) new dbSnP filter

Pindel Run: 
The results of run)pindel varies slightly (different version of Pindel?), but the results are largely in line with each other,

Using original dbSnP, final merge.vcf comparison looks good:

Using the new dbSnP, final merge.vcf differs somewhat from Song's run (see concordance.newDBSNP.dat):
